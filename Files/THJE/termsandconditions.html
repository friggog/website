Where any person is found to be reselling tickets to persons other than their invited guests (whose names appear on the original application form) for personal profit/gain, admission to the Event will be refused to them and to the holder of any ticket affected by such a sale. No refund will be given in such a situation.</li>

                            <li>Any resale which would otherwise be allowed under section 9 above will be void (insofar as the validity of any ticket affected by such a sale is concerned) if conducted for a price different from that stated on the face of the ticket or in authorised publicity for the Event, and any ticket affected by such a sale will not be honoured by the Organisers.</li>
